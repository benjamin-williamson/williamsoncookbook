# About this Site 

On this site you will find a collection of various different recipes spanning different cultures. Each recipe is categorized on the food type (foundational, entree, etc.)

It is worth mentioning that if you see "Dependencies" listed on any of the recipes, that means that it requires another staple or foundational recipe before you can make the main dish. I will try to maintain back links to all of the dependencies to make it easier to navigate. 

As more recipes are added to the library, more thorough folder organization will be possible. I plan to add folders for vegetarian options, breads, sauces, and so on. 

Please send your recipes to me and I will add them to the cookbook. 

### Goal 

The goal of this digital cookbook is to allow the family access to a refined library of recipes and ingredients. It will eventually include ingredients and where to find/order them. Some recipes may take 5 minutes to make, and some may take a full week to finish. Overall, you should be sharing a "primo" dish every day together.
