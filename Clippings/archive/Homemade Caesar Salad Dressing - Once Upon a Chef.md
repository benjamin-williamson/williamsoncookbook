### My Recipe Videos

Though most people buy Caesar salad dressing in a bottle, homemade is incredibly easy to make and tastes so much better than store-bought. There are many variations, but this rich and creamy version is the one my whole family loves. It’s not too garlicky and not too fishy – it’s just right. Unlike authentic Caesar dressings which are made with olive oil and thickened with raw eggs, this one has a mayonnaise base, which means you don’t have to worry if you’re squeamish about raw eggs. My kids love this dressing so much that they’ve learned to make it themselves. They don’t even wait for me to make a salad; while I cook dinner, they sit at the kitchen table with a big heart of romaine and dip the leaves in.

This recipe is part of my classic salad dressing collection, which includes go-to recipes for oil and vinegar based dressings, like [vinaigrette](https://www.onceuponachef.com/sauces/vinaigrette.html) and [balsamic vinaigrette](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/balsamic-vinaigrette.html), as well as creamy dressings, such as [buttermilk ranch dressing](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/homemade-buttermilk-ranch-dressing.html) and [blue cheese dressing](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/blue-cheese-dressing.html), which are typically made with mayonnaise and dairy products.

## What You’ll Need To Make Caesar Salad Dressing

![how to make caesar salad](https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2010/08/caesar-salad-1-1-850x542.jpg)

Instead of whole anchovies, I use anchovy paste — makes it easy, especially if you’re squeamish about anchovies (just hold your nose and add it in; the dressing needs every last bit to taste like the real deal!)

For the cheese, it’s important to use imported Parmigiano-Reggiano from Italy; domestic Parmesan pales in comparison. You can always tell if it’s authentic by looking at the rind, which is embossed with the name over and over. If the cheese is already grated, it should be labeled “Parmigiano-Reggiano,” not “Parmesan.”

## Step-by-Step Instructions

Begin by whisking together the garlic, anchovy paste, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.

Next, whisk in the mayonnaise, Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt, and pepper.

The dressing will keep well in the fridge for about a week. For a main course Caesar, try pairing this with my [best grilled chicken](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/perfectly-grilled-chicken-breasts.html). Enjoy!

My family loves this rich and creamy Caesar salad dressing. It’s not overly garlicky or fishy — it’s just right.

### Ingredients

- 2 small garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon anchovy paste (see note)
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, from one lemon
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (I like the brand Maille)
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 cup mayonnaise, best quality such as Hellmann's Real
- ½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the garlic, anchovy paste, lemon juice, Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Add the mayonnaise, Parmigiano-Reggiano, salt and pepper and whisk until well combined. Taste and adjust to your liking. The dressing will keep well in the fridge for about a week.
2. Note: Anchovy paste can be found near the canned tuna in the supermarket.
