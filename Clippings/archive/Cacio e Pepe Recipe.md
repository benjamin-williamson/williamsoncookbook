It is among the most basic, simplest pastas there is, and one of the darlings of Rome, appearing on nearly every menu. Why? Because when made right, it is incredible. The secret, as it turns out, is to stir the mostly cooked pasta quite vigorously so that its starch emulsifies with the seasonings and added water.

1. Put a pot of salted water on to boil. In a large bowl, combine the cheeses and black pepper; mash with just enough cold water to make a thick paste. Spread the paste evenly in the bowl.
2. Once the water is boiling, add the pasta. The second before it is perfectly cooked (taste it frequently once it begins to soften), reserve a cup or so of the cooking water, then use tongs to quickly transfer the pasta to the bowl. Stir vigorously to coat the pasta, adding a teaspoon or two of olive oil and a bit of the pasta cooking water to thin the sauce if necessary. The sauce should cling to the pasta and be creamy but not watery.
3. Plate and dust each dish with additional pecorino and pepper. Serve immediately.

### Private Notes

Leave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.

Just wanted to say that everyone arguing about authenticity of this recipe or any variation thereof is doing the most authentically Roman thing you can do.

Sorry guys but this is not the right way to make Cacio e Pepe. You transfer the pasta into a skillet, put some of the pasta water there and slowly add the cheese while flip mixing the pasta to create your sauce that sticks. You have to do this for a good 1-2 minutes.

Peter's right: transfer pasta to a skillet with some pasta water when it's still 1-2 minutes undercooked and gradually add the cheese (+ more water if needed). But the most important detail for absolutely delicious cacio e pepe - toast whole peppercorns in a small cast iron skillet over medium to medium-high heat, shaking occasionally, for 2-3 minutes until aromatic or until they start to dance around in the skillet. Crush in a mortal and pestle and use instead of raw pepper. Amazing!

Day 1: As is. Perfect!  
Day 2: Feeling Frisky. Added preserved lemon and arugula. Mmmm.  
Day 3. Tried + anchovy, toasted garlic and arugula. Plus a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Rocks.  
Day 4: Thinking of an old standby, I filleted a few sardines, plus capers, preserved lemon and arugula. Oh, and a few bread crumbs toasted in olive oil + butter. How could it not be delicious?

Making a paste of the cheese and pepper with cold water is genius.

Tomorrow?? Thank you, Mr Bittman.

I'm laughing about the HUGE emotional response attached to this dish. Italians use a general rule of thumb and improvise as they go. Which is what I do. I'm second generation, which is close enough. Cheese, pasta, something to keep it wet and blendable, lots of pepper. The rest makes this "your own". Relax, for the love of ...(whomever you want), and enjoy!

I'm going to make it tonight for myself, using exactly 1/3 of all the listed ingredients. BUT, as Suellen wondered a while ago, WHY can't the cheeses be listed by weight instead of by CUPs? I asked this same question at much greater length in the Comments to the original article itself. An OUNCE of Parmesan can vary from 1/4 cup (Cuisinart) to 1 cup (Microplane) -- tonight I'll use an old hand grater and get about 1/2 cup....

My husband, Salvatore Corea, is the chef-owner of a restaurant in the East Village named after this Roman dish. Table-side, the homemade tonnarelli pasta is tossed right out of the wheel of cheese. It's both theatrical and delicious!

I can't understand why the people who found it "gloopy" didn't just do the most logical thing, once you add the cheese to the pasta, put it back over the heat and stir it until the cheese is melted and the "sauce" is thick and creamy. Often the scheese clumps together and is all stringy in lumps throughout the pasta and stuck to the pan, just put it back over the heat, stir, and it's a perfect sauce. Don't understand how anyone didn't think to just melt the cheese over heat to make it combine.

If you are interested in an authentic cacio e Pepe, visit Tales of Ambrosia and check out How to Make Cacio e Pepe like a Roman. There are detailed instructions and helpful comments. For certain, there is no parmigiana, butter, olive oil or cream in the real recipe.

WHY can't I print out all of these terrific comments with the recipe?!

I agree with peter. Transfer the pasta to a skillet and add cheese. Add cooking water if necessary and heat if the cheese remains clumpy. Double the volumes of cheese if using a microplane grater. Also, definitely use a microplane if you have one as the finer texture melts much more easily. If you don't have a microplane, consider buying one. They're fantastic as zesters, graters, and other tasks.

my standby when there's no food in the house and I'm starving. There's always pasta, olive oil, pepper, Romano and garlic.  
I do sauté minced garlic in oil and add it with the cheese and pepper.

Works great, even with \*gasp\* Kraft Parmesan cheese!

Not that I am a Martha Stewart fan, but Google that magazine's recipe. Calls for grana padino cheese and gives reason why. Always comes out perfecto.

Try this with Szechuan peppercorns added to the black pepper -- an idea the comes from the kids at the Woks of Life blog. It's amazingly good.

My recipe for Cacio e Pepe is Trader Joe's Cacio e Pepe (made in Italy) in a bag in the frozen foods section. Since we found it to be a bit too rich for our taste, I also boil water and add 2 oz. of DeCecco Spaghetti no. 12. I cook both pastas for 12 minutes. Once the DeCecco is al dente, I add it to TJ's Cacio e Pepe along with some pasta water and dinner is ready in under 20 minutes. Cheap, fast, and yummy.

how finely or coarsely ground should the pepper be?

No parmigiano reggiano, solo pecorino

If you want a glob of cheese near some watery pasta, follow this recipe. If you want your noodles coated nicely in a cheesy sauce instead, do what the commenter Peter says.

I have a Modernist spin on cacio e pepe: use melting salts. Sodium citrate is best, works like magic with hard cheeses to turn them into velvety sauces. Sodium citrate tastes like a mix of salt (contains sodium, think sodium chloride) and citrus' tanginess (citrus contains citric acid hence the name). This flavor of sodium citrate is not at all noticeable in the finished dish as the strongly flavored cheese dominates. I make the paste with a pinch of it then add a teaspoon of pasta water.

Used whole grain Rotini. Added chopped boneless, skinless chicken breast marinated in soy sauce and, also, chopped fresh tomato.

As a young child our neighbors across the street were an elderly couple who had immigrated from Italy. Often when I visited Mrs Nardini would make me a plate of this dish, I didn’t know until now it had a name. I only knew that it brought me comfort. Decades later the memory is my version of Proust’s madeleine.

You can't forget the import process of the PEPE! Grind the pepper, slowly toast in the pan, add water and simmer to make the pepe broth. Then add the pasta, cheese paste or dust, pasta water and stir vigorously.

For those who want to print comments. On my iPhone I place and hold my finger on a comment I want and magically the word Copy appears! Then touch the Copy, go back to the recipe and at the bottom is a place to add notes. I paste the note and go back to grab any other comments I desire and repeat the process. They are included when I send the recipe to the printer.

Watch Alex, the French guy on YouTube. No olive oil.

@NoBO Yes, this simple recipe is rife with potential stumbles. Here the author offers confidence that there will be a good outcome.

Basically, it's mac and cheese.

repeatedly trying to get this dish right, I still would end up with clumpy cheese stuck to the bottom of the pot and bland noodles no matter how well I mixed the cheese and pasta water. I came across an Italian grandmothers cooking channel on YouTube and this lady turned the cheese and pepper into a paste using small amounts of pasta water, then combining the paste with the pasta and more reserved pasta water. It works like a charm every time.

Why don't you post the link so we can all see it?

@Heidi Follow NoBO’s link. The author addresses the problem of cheese stuck to the bottom along with other obstacles.

I just get it frozen from Trader Joes. Really good plus I'm lazy.
