Broccoli cheddar soup is one of Jack’s favorite foods. Ask him about the version at Panera Bread, and he’ll go on and on about its creamy texture and rich, tangy, cheesy flavor. He never expected me to develop a broccoli cheddar soup recipe at home (unless you count [this vegan twist](https://www.loveandlemons.com/vegan-broccoli-soup/)), but with the holidays right around the corner, I thought it would be fun to surprise him with one.

So, on a gray, chilly day last weekend, when we were both craving comfort food, I finally made him this broccoli cheddar soup recipe. As we sat down with our steaming bowls, I waited anxiously to see what he’d think. I shouldn’t have worried. He took one taste and declared, “This recipe is even better than Panera’s broccoli cheddar soup!” A few minutes later, he was already heading back for seconds. I hope you love this recipe too!

## Broccoli Cheddar Soup Recipe Ingredients

Here’s what you’ll need to make this broccoli cheddar soup recipe:

- **Broccoli**, of course! Cut it into small, bite-sized pieces so that you get some in every spoonful of soup.
- **Onion and garlic** – They add savory depth of flavor.
- **Butter and flour** – They create a roux that thickens the soup.
- **Milk** – It perfects the soup’s creamy texture. Whole milk is traditional in broccoli cheese soup, and it works great here, but I often use [unsweetened almond milk](https://www.loveandlemons.com/how-to-make-almond-milk/) instead, and it works nicely too. The soup is a tad less thick, but it’s still delicious!
- **Vegetable broth** – Use store-bought, or [make your own](https://www.loveandlemons.com/how-to-make-vegetable-stock/).
- **Carrot** – You can finely chop it or [julienne it](https://www.loveandlemons.com/how-to-julienne-carrots/). I personally like to julienne it because the shredded carrots remind me of grated cheese, and I think they give the soup a fun, extra-cheesy look.
- **Dijon mustard** – It adds tangy, peppery depth of flavor.
- **Cheddar cheese** – It wouldn’t be broccoli cheddar soup without it! Sharp cheddar cheese is my fave, but feel free to opt for a mild cheddar if your prefer.
- **And salt and pepper** – To make all the flavors pop!

## Broccoli Cheese Soup Recipe Tips

- **Grate the cheese yourself.** Pre-shredded cheese is often coated in anti-caking agents that can prevent the cheese from melting into a lusciously creamy soup. To ensure that your broccoli cheddar soup has the best smooth and creamy texture, buy a block of cheese and grate it yourself.
- **Whisk continuously** when you add the flour and milk. At first, whisking prevents the flour from burning on the bottom of the pot with the butter. Once you add the milk, it evenly disperses the flour and butter in the liquid, thickening the soup and preventing lumps from forming.
- **Go low and slow.** When you add the cheese to the soup, make sure that the pot is over very low heat. If the heat is too high, the cheese won’t incorporate into the soup, giving it a thin, gloopy texture. I also recommend adding a little at a time and stirring well between additions.
- **Reheat it on the stove.** Leftovers will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. To reheat them, you’ll once again need to go low and slow. Skip the microwave, and warm the soup on the stovetop instead. Place it in a saucepan over medium-low heat, and stir occasionally until heated through. Reheated this way, the soup should stay thick and creamy. If you try to rush the process and crank up the heat, the soup will separate. Trust me, I learned the hard way!
