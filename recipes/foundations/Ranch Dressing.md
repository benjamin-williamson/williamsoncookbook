# Restaurant-style ranch dressing

### Ingredients
- 1 cup Duke's mayo (224g) - Hellman's is ok in a pinch
- 1/2 cup sour cream (120g)
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 1 1/2 packets Hidden Valley Ranch dressing (I shoot for 45g)

### Steps
1. Mix all Ingredients until smooth

This is more of a dipping ranch than for adding to lettuce. You can thin it out to be pourable with more buttermilk.
